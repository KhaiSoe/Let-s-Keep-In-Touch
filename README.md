# Let's Keep In Touch!

This app is specifically created for users who tend to lose their business cards. 
The goal of the app is to allow the users to store business cards instantly as they receive them (by scanning the cards)

Future Iterations: 
1. the users to call or email or chat the persons on those business cards.
2. this app will eliminate the usage of business cards by allowing this app users to share each other's information via the app.
