Let's Keep In Touch!

This app is specifically created for users who tend to lose their business cards. 
The end goal of the app is to allow the users to store business cards instantly as they receive them (by scanning the cards), the users to call or email or chat the persons on those business cards.
In the future, this app will eliminate the usage of business cards by allowing this app users to share each other's information via the app. 

For MVP (within 2 weeks): This app will allow users to scan pictures, to detect text and store it in a database.

The app will collect data/text when users scan pictures/posters/advertisments, persisting it locally using SQLite, and displaying that data on the screen.
The users will be able to edit the data within the app after it has been added. 

The end goal will be worked on continuously after the MVP is finished.
